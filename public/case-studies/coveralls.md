## What is Coveralls?

Coveralls: code coverage as a service. I worked on Coveralls back in
2012 at Lemur Heavy Industries with [Wil Gieseler](//github.com/wilg) as the
lead developer. As the only designer on Coveralls, I was responsible for the
overall UX and UI design.

## Branding Coveralls

We viewed Coveralls as a "call to arms" with code coverage. When I was
designing the homepage for Coveralls, I referenced many World War II
propaganda posters for the look and feel. My goal for the marketing pages was
to have a playful, yet serious, take on something that's possibly overlooked
during the development process.

## Organizing information on Coveralls

There are a lot of information presented to the user in Coveralls: Build
number, coverage percentage, repo name, branch name, committer, date, etc. On
the updates page, I made an effort to emphasize commits that changed code
coverage by having other commits be slightly transparent.

Looking back, I would've removed other details that didn't provide as much
valuable information such as build number.

On the repos page, the most valuable information for a user is the current
state of code coverage of their repos. I made sure to emphasize the percentage
as the top level hierarchy.

## The future of Coveralls

One of the last things I worked on for Coveralls was the landing page for the
[Enterprise service](//enterprise.coveralls.io). For this homepage, I looked ahead and captured the
look and feel of the [Space Age](//offworld.gizmodo.com/twenty-awesome-covers-from-the-us-space-program-461436874)
and [Googie architecture](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie_architecture).
