## A Secret Set With Waters

Audyssey, with Noise Pop and BAMM.tv, launched theneighborhood.tv and hosted
various secret shows around San Francisco. I was asked to create a promotional
poster for a secret set featuring WATERS.

At the time I haven't heard of Waters so I immediately listened to his music
and brainstormed different ideas.

The poster centers around themes about journeys, personal struggles, and the
lo-fi aesthetic of his music.

    The image was printed on cardstock and turned into buttons. Sweet!

## Modeselektor at The El Rey

In 2010, Modeselektor performed at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. In
preparation for the show, I created a poster for personal use.

I depicted the monkey trademark of Modeselektor and the playfulness of their
music along with their wide range of influences (represented as different
cultural references.)
