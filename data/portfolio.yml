    role: Design
    description: "As Tandem Stills + Motion grows 2-years-old as well as its image archive, the new homepage needed to showcase exactly what makes Tandem stand out as the best photography provider. The solution: Put images from the Tandem collection front and center. Tandem also provides a white label service called 'vault' for larger companies looking to archive their own images. More info can be found at tandemvault.com. I worked on the design for the new Tandem Stock homepage as well as the marketing page for Tandem Vault. Work done at LEMUR Heavy Industries."

    role: Design
    description: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
