  <h1>Hi There!</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a designer based in San Francisco. Previously, I worked at
    <a href="//thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot, inc</a> and
    <a href="//lemurheavy.com">LEMUR Heavy Industries</a>. Before that, I studied
    Graphic Design at <a href="http://otis.edu">Otis College of Art and Design</a>
    in Los Angeles.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe good design is informed by research, testing, and
    collaboration with users, stakeholders, fellow designers, and developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience is the result of working with many clients and colleagues.
    One of the many things I've learned from my co-workers include using serif
    typefaces for body text and sans-serifs for headers.

  <p>
    I blurt useless things on

    force-push code to
    <a href="//github.com/donokuda" class="link-github">GitHub</a>,
    crop designs on
    <a href="//dribbble.com/donokuda" class="link-dribbble">Dribbble</a>, and
    drop the bass on
    <a href="//soundcloud.com/upvote-for-visibility" class="link-soundcloud">Soundcloud</a>.
